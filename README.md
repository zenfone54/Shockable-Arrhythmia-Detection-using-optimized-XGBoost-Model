# Automatic shockable Arrhythmia detection using ECG signals by Subham Mukherjee
This repository hosts MATLAB scripts for preprocessing ECG signals from the CUDB and VFDB datasets, as well as feature extraction. Additionally, it includes Python codes for evaluating the performance of various machine learning models and optimizing the XGBoost model. Ongoing work is being done to compare the performance and computational efficiency of various metaheuristic optimization algorithms to tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model.
